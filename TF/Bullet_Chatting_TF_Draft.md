# Bullet Chatting Task Force

## Mission

The Bullet Chatting Task Force is part of the Media & Entertainment Interest Group. The Task Force is responsible for gathering use cases and deriving technical requirements for Bullet Chatting, which refers to comments or annotations overlaid on the video playback screen, synced to a specific playback time.

## Basic Information

* Start Date: TBD
* End Date: TBD
* Confidentiality: Public
* Initial Moderator(s): Song Xu (China Mobile)
* Meeting Schedule: TBD

(xfq: re meeting schedule, besides the monthly MEIG call, we can have: 1/ monthly/periodically TF meetings, or 2/ topic-specific meetings when needed. What do you think?)

## Success Criteria

We have succeeded if we can fulfil the following tasks:

* Definition of scenarios and use cases
* Definition of specific technical requirements
* Identified gaps in the Web platform where technical requirements are not currently met
* Proposed solutions to those gaps

## Dependencies

The Bullet Chatting Task Force will work with the following W3C groups.

* Timed Text WG
* Chinese Web IG
* Bullet Chatting CG

(xfq: we might want to think about the collaboration model between the Bullet Chatting TF and the CG, and/or is the CG really needed. Our current focus may be use cases, but we need a CG/WG to incubate the technical proposal(s) to fill the gaps we identified, if any.)

## Communication

* This Task Force primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list at public-web-and-tv@w3.org (archive).
* TF emails should be labelled accordingly, by prefixing the email subject with the TF identifier "[Bullet Chatting]". See W3C mailing list and archive usage guidelines.
* There is also a member-only list to be used for administrative purposes at member-web-and-tv@w3.org (archive).
* The moderator maintains the Task Force page on the public Wiki, with the help of the Task Force participants if needed.
