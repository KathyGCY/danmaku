In this scenario, the user can send the content of the Bullet Chatting to the display wall in an offline event. The wall can be a pure Bullet Chatting application, without any video or other content on the big screen. The wall only shows the discussions at the venue or online, and enhances the event atmosphere to make participants have a stronger sense of participation.This is a common scenario, so the bullet chatting rendering behavior standardized should cover this scenario.

### Gaps:
For exampleï¼ŒThe WebVTT or TTML rendering subtitles is within the video playback area.In this kind of scenario, the Bullet Chatting is displayed separately and is not attached to the video. Therefore, it is helpful for this scenario that the rendering area(like size, z-index) can be configured.
